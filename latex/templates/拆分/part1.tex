Trump's speech from the White House History Conference at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., focused on bashing "The 1619 Project," which is a New York Times project aimed at reframing "the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative." Earlier this month he threatened to withhold federal funding for public schools in California that incorporated the 1619 Project into the history curriculum.
