\item{
    Mr and Mrs Smith open a small \underline{ 1 restaurant } in America. To attract people, they put a notice on the door, and \underline{ 2 it} says, ``Meals on the House for Three Days.''

    \hspace{2em} 
    A Chinese student comes to the US and he doesn't know \underline{ 3 much } English. On Monday after he has afternoon classes, he walks past the restaurant. It is time for dinner and he feels very hungry. ``Well, I am going to have \underline{ 4 something } to eat.'' When he walks to the restaurant, he sees the notice. ``American people are really \underline{ 5 interesting }. They even have meals on the house! But \underline{ 6 how } can I get to the top of the house?'' he thinks.

    \hspace{2em} 
    He looks around and finds a ladder \underline{ 7 near } the restaurant. He is very happy. But when he gets to the top, he hears someone shouting at him. ``Hey! What are you doing there?'' Mr Smith and a policeman are standing there and \underline{ 8 looking at } him. ``Doesn't your notice say `Meals on the House for Three Days'? Is it \underline{ 9 only} a joke?'' the student asks. When Mr Smith and the policeman hear this, they start laughing. ``Do you know what `ON THE HOUSE' means? It means you don't have to give money for the meal! It's \underline{ 10 free}!'' the policeman says.
